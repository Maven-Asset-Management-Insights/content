## Executive Takeaway
Most Maximo and reliability initiatives start strong and then slowly fade.

The difference between lasting value and stalled progress is governance.

---

## The Familiar Pattern
Organizations invest heavily in:
- Maximo upgrades
- reliability assessments
- PM optimization
- new reporting

Six months later:
- standards loosen
- data quality slips
- work practices drift
- leadership attention moves elsewhere

The system remains.  
The discipline does not.

## Why Governance Is Often Misunderstood
Governance is not bureaucracy.

Effective governance:
- clarifies ownership
- reinforces standards
- creates visibility
- sustains discipline

It answers a simple question:
> “Who ensures this stays true next quarter?”

---

## What Effective Governance Looks Like
Successful programs establish a predictable rhythm:

### Monthly
- data quality checks
- KPI review
- exceptions discussed

### Quarterly
- PM effectiveness review
- reliability strategy updates
- asset criticality validation

### Annually
- standards refresh
- roadmap alignment
- capability reassessment

Governance is lightweight, but relentless.

## How Maximo Supports Governance
Maximo enables governance when:
- standards are configured, not implied
- workflows reinforce expectations
- reporting aligns to decisions leaders actually make

Without governance, Maximo becomes passive.

---

## Maven Perspective
Governance is what turns improvement into habit.

It’s the difference between knowing what good looks like, and staying there.
